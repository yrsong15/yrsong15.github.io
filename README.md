#####June 24, 2016
+ Worked on HTML/CSS functionalities for the past few days, via my own blog.
+ Sketched out mapping of website, including cover page(leads to main page), main page(galleries of pictures, each of which links to letters), and letters for each picture on the main page.
+ Began working on cover page.

#####June 22th, 2016
+ Decided against using external templates or hosts; this means I will be making every file from scratch. Figured out how to use external CSS stylesheets for added functionality.
+ Domain name will be **raymeetsnicole.com**, page title will be **365 Days of Nicole**.

#####June 21th, 2016
+ Leaning more towards the idea of using an external template as suggested by KA, as opposed to trying to code the entire webpage from scratch, for aesthetic reasons.    


#####June 20, 2016
+ First conceived idea on website. Looks like it will be a long online letter coupled with pictures of the two of us. Domain name is tentatively either: raymeetsnicole.com or 365daysofnicole.com
