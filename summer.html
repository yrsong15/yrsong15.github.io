        <p>Aqueti has been a pleasant surprise for me. Not only am I exposed to the startup environment, which is something that is totally new for me, I am also gaining a very good insight into the industry's view of computer science. I still have a <span id = "long">long</span> way to go, but hopefully this will lead to something good.</p>

        <p>Life off campus has been one of the best parts of my new routine. Not only am I eating food that I really wanted to eat, I'm eating it for really cheap. </p>

        <p>My room is quite spacious, and the rent is mind-bogglingly low. This is actually quite awesome. I wish the blog would let me post pictures of my room, just so I can show how great it is, but oh well.</p>
