            So, for the last three weeks I've been creating the anniversary project website for Nicole. The idea first hit me out of nowhere - quite literally, in that I was biking home after work, and the idea just struck me. I guess a lot of it had to do with the fact that I was just picking up basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript tutorials from Khan Academy. While racking my brains for what to get her, especially since she didn't want flowers(my go-to present up until now), I came up with an idea: <strong>why don't I create something from scratch?</strong> That way, it'll be a truly one-of-a-kind gift, one that I'd poured my heart into.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I soon discovered, things were easier said than done. I had a whole idea sketched on paper, but implementing the nitty details via HTML/CSS wasn't the easiest thing in the world, at least partially because I had just started teaching myself the details. Minute implementations often took hours of Googling plus trial and error, and honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I <em> had</em> to make this work, I would probably have met myself halfway between and compromised with what I could make.
        </p>
        <p>
            What started out as a small idea developed into a full-scale idea that would take weeks to complete. Not only did I have to create the skeletal structure for the website, I would also fill each page with a lengthy letter, complete with pictures. I've never been happier with iPhotos, which not only copies every photo from my iPhone to my MacBook, but also enables easy file transfers so that I wouldn't have to use a cloud server or anything. Best of all, going through all the pictures of us throughout the past year really made me realize just how much Nicole means to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The webpage has been hosted as a Github Project Page, with an external domain purchased through Google domain. Everything was a first for me, and it took some errors to get everything correct, but now things are good to go.

            The link is as follows: <a href="http://raymeetsnicole.com">raymeetsnicole.com</a>. I plan on continuously updating the website with more of our adventures, so hold on tight - it's going to be a bumpy ride!

            Today I've decided to start taking classes via Coursera. Now, I've been taking Khan Academy classes for the past month, and don't get me wrong, they've been great. However, I also did feel that the KA classes were targeted for younger people, while the Coursera courses not only offered more advanced subjects (Ruby on Rails, R, you name it), but they really do seem like college classes - partially because they're taught by college professors. Duh. Anyways, looking forward to the classes coming up, I've even started to take notes, just as I would approach a real class!

            Three weeks into my internship, and really, nothing has been easy. The first week was cool, in that I seemed to breeze over the test projects that I was given. But then I was handed a project that I have been trying to deal with for the past two weeks, to no real avail. This is painful, especially because I feel as if I haven't been able to contribute to this team for the past two weeks. Ugh.

        <p>Aqueti has been a pleasant surprise for me. Not only am I exposed to the startup environment, which is something that is totally new for me, I am also gaining a very good insight into the industry's view of computer science. I still have a <span id = "long">long</span> way to go, but hopefully this will lead to something good.</p>
