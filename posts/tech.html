            Today I've decided to start taking classes via Coursera. Now, I've been taking Khan Academy classes for the past month, and don't get me wrong, they've been great. However, I also did feel that the KA classes were targeted for younger people, while the Coursera courses not only offered more advanced subjects (Ruby on Rails, R, you name it), but they really do seem like college classes - partially because they're taught by college professors. Duh. Anyways, looking forward to the classes coming up, I've even started to take notes, just as I would approach a real class!

            Three weeks into my internship, and really, nothing has been easy. The first week was cool, in that I seemed to breeze over the test projects that I was given. But then I was handed a project that I have been trying to deal with for the past two weeks, to no real avail. This is painful, especially because I feel as if I haven't been able to contribute to this team for the past two weeks. Ugh.

        <p>Aqueti has been a pleasant surprise for me. Not only am I exposed to the startup environment, which is something that is totally new for me, I am also gaining a very good insight into the industry's view of computer science. I still have a <span id = "long">long</span> way to go, but hopefully this will lead to something good.</p>
