            Hi! My name's <span>Young Re Song</span>, but a lot of people just call me <span>Ray</span> - at least partially because far too often I've had to tell them that my name's not Young Song. As a rising junior at Duke University studying Computer Science and Economics, I aspire to empower those around me through coding and writing.

            When I'm not making something, laboring over coursework, or FaceTiming my girlfriend, I enjoy working out, playing pickup basketball or League of Legends, watching Duke Basketball and the NBA, or playing with my Roborovski hamster, Cheese.
