            Hi! My name's <span>Young Re</span>, but a lot of people just call me <span>Ray</span> - at least partially because far too often I've had to tell them that my name's not Young Song. As a rising junior at Duke University studying Computer Science and Economics, I aspire to empower those around me through coding and writing.

            <!-- on writing and why this blog was made -->
            Writing has always been a part of me. Though I was born and raised in Korea for the first 19 years of my life, I've always felt in my own skin when I convey my own ideas through English writings and essays. For years I've kept a personal archive of Microsoft Word files that contain my thoughts and perspectives on a multitude of issues, but they've always been just that - an archive hidden in the depths of my own laptop. 
        </p>
        <p>
            See, the thing is, I'm not the biggest fan of posting every tidbit on social media, not only because I don't want to spam others' News Feeds, but also because it's like writing a diary - in the sense that I wouldn't mind if anyone else read it, but I also wouldn't necessarily broadcast it for everyone to see. Thus this webpage was created as a medium between my desire to write and my unwillingness to post everything on social media.

            And yes, everything on this webpage has been created by yours truly, including the underlying HTML/CSS code, <a href="https://github.com/yrsong15/yrsong15.github.io">which can be seen on my Github page.</a>
        <p>
            As for me, when I'm not making something, laboring over coursework, or FaceTiming my incredibly smart and beautiful girlfriend<span>(hi Nicole!!)</span>, I enjoy cycling/working out, playing pickup basketball or <em>League of Legends</em>, ardently following the NBA, camping out for weeks in K-Ville for the fabled Duke-North Carolina game, and playing with my adorable Roborovski hamster, Cheese.
