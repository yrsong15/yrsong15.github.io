            Hi! My name's <span>Young Re</span>, but a lot of people just call me <span>Ray</span> - at least partially because far too often I've had to tell them that my name's not Young Song. A proud graduate of Duke University (go Blue Devils!) with a degree in Computer Science and Economics, I am currently a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At heart, I'm just a 20-something-year-old who is hoping to make sense of things that inherently make absolutely no sense, such as this world, our lives, and the small things that make us smile and cry. I have been fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of more luck than I will ever deserve, and I can only hope that I will be able to reciprocate the magnanimity that my family, friends, and random run-ins have presented me with.
        </p>

            Writing has always been a part of me. Though I was born and raised in Korea for the first 19 years of my life, I've always felt in my own skin when I convey my own ideas through English writings and essays. For years I've kept a personal archive of Microsoft Word files that contain my thoughts and perspectives on a multitude of issues, but they've always been just that - an archive hidden in the depths of my own laptop. Thus what began as a simple HTML/CSS exercise in Khan Academy developed into what you see here now: a medium between my desire to write and my unwillingness to post every tidbit on social media.

            When I'm not making something awesome, I enjoy cycling/working out, playing pickup basketball, hiking trails in national parks all over the world, learning hot yoga, ardently following the NBA, baking some mean cakes/cookies, and scouring whatever neighborhood I happen to be in for the best beer/wine in town.
