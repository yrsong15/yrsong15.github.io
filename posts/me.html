            Hi! My name's <span>Young Re</span>, but a lot of people just call me <span>Ray</span> - at least partially because far too often I've had to tell them that my name's not Young Song. As a rising junior at Duke University studying Computer Science and Economics, I aspire to empower those around me through coding and writing. 
        </p>

            <!-- on writing and why this blog was made -->
            Writing has always been a part of me. Though I was born and raised in Korea for the first 19 years of my life, I've always felt in my own skin when I convey my own ideas through English writings and essays. For years I've kept a personal archive of Microsoft Word files that contain my thoughts and perspectives on a multitude of issues, but they've always been just that - an archive hidden in the depths of my own laptop. 
        </p>
        <p>
            See, the thing is, I'm not the biggest fan of posting every tidbit on social media, not only because I didn't want to spam others' News Feeds, but also because I feared that the "Likes" would make me conform to what would be expected of me to write, as opposed to what I really wanted to write. It's like writing a diary in the sense that I wouldn't mind if anyone else read it, but I also wouldn't necessarily broadcast it for everyone to see. Thus this webpage was created as a medium between my desire to write and my unwillingness to post everything on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, everything on this webpage has been created by me and me only, including the underlying HTML/CSS code, <a href="https://github.com/yrsong15/yrsong15.github.io">which has been shared on my Github account.</a>
        <p>
            As for me, when I'm not making something, laboring over coursework, or FaceTiming my girlfriend<span>(hi Nicole!!)</span>, I enjoy working out, playing pickup basketball or League of Legends, following the NBA, tenting out in K-Ville for the fabled Duke-North Carolina game, and playing with my adorable Roborovski hamster, Cheese.
