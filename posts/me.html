            Hi! My name's <span>Young Re</span>, but a lot of people just call me <span>Ray</span> - at least partially because far too often I've had to tell them that my name's not Young Song. A proud graduate of Duke University (go Blue Devils!) with a degree in Computer Science and Economics, I am currently a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY.

        <p>
            At heart, I'm just a confused man-child hoping to make sense of a world that makes no sense. I have been fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of more luck than I will ever deserve, and I can only hope that I will be able to reciprocate the magnanimity that my family, friends, and random run-ins have presented me with.
        </p>

            Writing has always been a part of me. Though I was born and raised in Korea for the first 19 years of my life, I've always felt in my own skin when I convey my own ideas through English writings and essays. For years I've kept a personal archive of Microsoft Word files that contain my thoughts and perspectives on a multitude of issues, but they've always been just that - an archive hidden in the depths of my own laptop. Thus what began as a simple HTML/CSS exercise in Khan Academy developed into what you see here now: a medium between my desire to write and my unwillingness to post every tidbit on social media.
        </p> -->

            When I'm not tinkering away, I enjoy skiing, running, camping in national parks, ardently following all Duke sports, baking some mean cakes/cookies, and scouring whatever neighborhood I happen to be in for the best beer/wine in town.

            And yes, everything on this webpage has been created by yours truly from scratch with bare-bone HTML/CSS - you can peek into the spaghetti <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/yrsong15/yrsong15.github.io">here.</a> In fact, this whole thing was borne out of my very first Khan Academy exercise, as I hastily attempted to learn JavaScript a week before the beginning of my summer internship!
