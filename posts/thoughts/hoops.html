            I didn't think that I'd be writing this much about the NBA. But then again, I didn't think that the offseason would be this dynamic, with massive changes taking place every other day, or so it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Big story of the day: <strong>Tim Duncan has retired.</strong> Now, I've never professed myself to be a TD fan - in fact, I had even tried to <em>become</em> his fan when I was in middle school, only to be disappointed by his lackluster highlight films. And even now, after 10+ years, I have yet to understand just how proficient he had been in the art of basketball.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet his retirement really stings because of what he had brought to the table for the past 19 years: <strong>humble greatness</strong>. Despite all the limelight that his fellow peers receive, not once has Timmy craved for attention - rather, he just stuck to what he did best, which was to win basketball games. In an era where exposure seems to be more valued than skills (Exhibit One: Nick Young, and the media exposure that he gets), Timmy really showed what it is like to be a humble superstar, an oxymoron that's much harder to live out than it is to say. That he had carried himself the way he did all throughout his career, despite being one of the all-time greats, should receive more accolades than any other NBA news has for the past few weeks, if not years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The word <em>respect</em> has not been this suitable for a single individual in a long time. Much respect, TD.

            I woke up to a random Groupme text that a diehard OKC friend of mine had sent to another friend, a native of SF. The text read: <strong>"I hate your stupid basketball team!!!!!"</strong> It took a while for my still-asleep brain to process what had happened: that Kevin Durant announced his decision to join the Warriors.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was disheartening on so many levels. One, he would no longer be joining the Celtics, my fav (I actually asked Nicole to get me a Durant Celtics jersey for our anniversary gift - I really did believe there was a chance). Two, another franchise player had left his team, making it one less superstar to follow the paths of the Stocktons, Kobes, Duncans, and Dirks (this was why the Derrick Rose trade to the Knicks made total sense on a basketball level, but not so much on an emotional level). And three, perhaps most importantly, the league will now be seeing another SuperTeam, this time in the form of the Splash Fam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charles Barkley famously noted back in 2012 that a superteam would never have been possible in the 80s and the 90s because players' egos were too big to join forces with their rivals. And heartbreaking as it may be that greats like him, Stockton, and Malone never got to win a single ring, it was probably the <strong>very aspect of the game that made it so much more interesting</strong> - that you really didn't have a strong favorite, and even the dynasty, the Bulls, always had opponents thwarting them at every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, of course the Warriors will have their share of adversities. But everybody is going to take their championship status for granted, if they ever get there, and anything short of it would be considered a pathetic waste of talent. I've been a huge Steph Curry fan because of how humbly he carries himself and how electrifying his game is. The fact that LeBron was part of a SuperTeam himself back in Miami contributed a lot to why I rooted for GSW in the past two Finals. Now, Curry, Durant, and Thompson, three of my favorite players in the game right now, have joined forces. And unfortunately, it seems like basketball as we knew has taken a turn for the worse.
