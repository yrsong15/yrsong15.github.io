            <strong>What is logic?</strong> I’m sure millions of scholars have chipped in on this abstract yet all-too-important topic, but just as all important topics go, the question has yet to be answered definitively, if ever. 
        </p>
        <p>

            My personal take is that logic is a systematic method of reasoning characterized by inductive steps. Logic is beautiful because it is <strong>science in its verbal form</strong> – regardless of the profession in which you indulge in, you need logic to elucidate your claims, whether it may be computer science, cooking, chore instructions, and everything in between. Sound logic requires no explanation because its brevity and lucidity is enough all by itself. You’ll know it when you see one – it’s one of those explanations that make you think, “Why haven’t I thought of this before!” or “How did I not understand this before!”
        </p>
        <p>

            Entering college, I wanted to be an economics major – a very rich field in its own right, but one that tends to focus a lot on theories and models, especially in the undergraduate level. After a whole year’s worth of if’s and maybe’s, my first computer science class that I signed up on a complete whim absolutely captivated me. It was so clear-cut, and the answers were always very straightforward, in that you were either right, or you weren’t – there was no shade of gray.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as beautiful computer code was, often I was stuck by the subtle nuances of programming syntax. My head knew exactly what it wanted to do, but far too often I was stuck because my hands could not execute the commands that my brain had come up with.  As stress built up, I even started to think that computer science wasn’t my thing. If it took 3 hours just to solve this simple of a question, how would I ever be able to come up with the next Facebook, the next Snapchat?
        </p>
        <p>
            It was only after months and months of Stack Overflow and office hours that I first ran into the concept of <strong>Computational Thinking</strong>, which would teach students to think systematically and programmatically <strong>without having to go through the burdens of computer code syntax</strong> – a concept highlighted by <a href="https://projectbloks.withgoogle.com/">Google’s Project Bloks</a>, as well as scholarly works of eminent researchers including <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wing/">Dr. Jeannette Wing</a> of Carnegie Mellon University. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This concept was the very essence of why I fell in love with computer science – the realization of logic. I tend to think of computer science as Lego blocks that I used to play with as a child, in that each line of code is a block that makes up a make-alike miniature world of my dreams. In addition to classwork and RA responsibilities, I intend to conduct research on this subject so that I can best utilize the resources granted to me by Duke, and also to satiate my academic thirst in a field that I haven’t felt so passionate towards in a very long time.

            The past two weeks have been extensively spent on picking up <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> for one reason only: I wanted to implement an integrative feature into my websites, something that HTML/CSS just isn't capable of doing. The first brainchild of this endeavor is tentatively planned to be the <strong>Giles 2016 project</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot has changed since my RA appointment a few weeks ago, but along with the challenges came the potential opportunities, especially when I recalled <em>my own</em> freshman experience and just how hectic/confusing everything was. I've been giving it a lot of thought with regards to what features would be implemented: would it be an online announcement board, a qDuke-like link to other useful sites, or something else? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Answers didn't come right away, but as I progressed on with the RoR tutorial I came to the idea of a curated FAQ list, albeit one curated by the admin - me. The client would land onto a News Feed-like page that has a set of <strong>Q&As</strong>: questions from their fellow peers and answers from the admin. The corner of the page would feature a button that links the user to another page where she can ask questions(this question wouldn't be visible to others, only to the admin and the person who asked it). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The admin side would feature all of the questions, and the admin would have two primary roles: 1. answer all questions, and 2. feature what she considers to be important questions on the landing page - the same News Feed-like page that clients are first exposed to by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to implement this project by mid-August, so that freshmen can seamlessly use this application. Yes, there will be <em>a lot</em> of issues coming up, and truth be told I'd be really impressed if I could indeed launch this by mid-August, but hey, a man's got to dream.

            Over the past few days I've done a lot of thinking and some engineering to change how this website is to be run. I've been picking up Ruby on Rails because HTML/CSS is the best way to display a static website, but has next to no functionalities when it comes to interactive capabilities. And while I don't see the need for a dynamic interaction for this website <em>per se</em>, I do think that by learning different capabilities I would be able to better display what/how I want, without technical capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step has been reorganizing the Thoughts page, which used to be a long stream of text on a single page. Sure, it's not a problem as of now, but as the number of posts increase, I felt that there would be a need to better organize posts. An ideal way to do this would be to implement a calendar functionality as well as a categorization of my thoughts for better organization, but honestly I have no idea how to implement tags, let alone calendars, at this point (now that I think of it, I do think that HTML offers some type of calendar, I should look into it).
        </p>
        <p>
            The second part has been Bootstrap, which I've started to pick up for aesthetics' sake. The index page has already been redesigned with Bootstrap, but I've been stuck on doing the same for the Thoughts page, especially with regards to implementing Bootstrap and my own stylesheet at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the day, the skills I pick up and the practice I do with this website(which is effectively acting as my own sandbox) will <strong>help me engineer the Cloud IR project, as well as the Giles 2016 page</strong>. The idea now for Giles 2016 is that I would have students ask questions on the site, and I would publicly display the ones that I think would benefit other students as well, while filtering out the useless ones(perhaps I could answer them without posting them?). As long as I figure out how to actually do it, the process of making the sites sounds quite intriguing, to say the least.

            So, for the last three weeks I've been creating the anniversary project website for Nicole. The idea first hit me out of nowhere - quite literally, in that I was biking home after work, and the idea just struck me. I guess a lot of it had to do with the fact that I was just picking up basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript tutorials from Khan Academy. While racking my brains for what to get her, especially since she didn't want flowers(my go-to present up until now), I came up with an idea: <strong>why don't I create something from scratch?</strong> That way, it'll be a truly one-of-a-kind gift, one that I'd poured my heart into.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I soon discovered, things were easier said than done. I had a whole idea sketched on paper, but implementing the nitty details via HTML/CSS wasn't the easiest thing in the world, at least partially because I had just started teaching myself the details. Minute implementations often took hours of Googling plus trial and error, and honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I <em> had</em> to make this work, I would probably have met myself halfway between and compromised with what I could make.
        </p>
        <p>
            What started out as a small idea developed into a full-scale idea that would take weeks to complete. Not only did I have to create the skeletal structure for the website, I would also fill each page with a lengthy letter, complete with pictures. I've never been happier with iPhotos, which not only copies every photo from my iPhone to my MacBook, but also enables easy file transfers so that I wouldn't have to use a cloud server or anything. Best of all, going through all the pictures of us throughout the past year really made me realize just how much Nicole means to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The webpage has been hosted as a Github Project Page, with an external domain purchased through Google domain. Everything was a first for me, and it took some errors to get everything correct, but now things are good to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            The link is as follows: <a href="http://raymeetsnicole.com">raymeetsnicole.com</a>. I plan on continuously updating the website with more of our adventures, so hold on tight - it's going to be a bumpy ride!

            Today I've decided to start taking classes via Coursera. Now, I've been taking Khan Academy classes for the past month, and don't get me wrong, they've been great. However, I also did feel that the KA classes were targeted for younger people, while the Coursera courses not only offered more advanced subjects (Ruby on Rails, R, you name it), but they really do seem like college classes - partially because they're taught by college professors. Duh. Anyways, looking forward to the classes coming up, I've even started to take notes, just as I would approach a real class!

            Three weeks into my internship, and really, nothing has been easy. The first week was cool, in that I seemed to breeze over the test projects that I was given. But then I was handed a project that I have been trying to deal with for the past two weeks, to no real avail. This is painful, especially because I feel as if I haven't been able to contribute to this team for the past two weeks. Ugh.

        <p>Aqueti has been a pleasant surprise for me. Not only am I exposed to the startup environment, which is something that is totally new for me, I am also gaining a very good insight into the industry's view of computer science. I still have a <span id = "long">long</span> way to go, but hopefully this will lead to something good.</p>
