             A lot has happened in life over the past few days: Nicole and I celebrated our first anniversary in New York, Pokemon GO fad is still raging on, I've started picking up Bootstrap and RoR, I'll be working as a CS230 TA next semester, my bike was stolen from my apartment over the weekend, and work is almost coming to a close. And as important as these matters are, they can be written about some other time. Today I want to discuss something on a more serious note - current issues, especially the <strong>shootings/bombings</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So much has happened over the past month, nay, the past week, that I fear I might even grow a little oblivious to all the horrors taking place in this world. The main storyline here in the US has been the Black Lives Matter campaign following two separate casualties in Baton Rouge and Minnesota, which then (perhaps indirectly, but nevertheless) led to the police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge. As chaos unfolded in the States, France suffered from a horrific incident in Nice involving a deranged truck, Turkey faced a coup-de-etat, and people are being executed in Syria as I write these feeble words, feeling absolutely helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was young(well, I guess I'm still young at 23, but you know what I mean), I wanted to be a diplomat, not just because I was more fluent in English than my Korean peers, but because I really did think that world peace would be attainable. Change happened somwhere along the way and now I call myself a computer engineer, but deep inside, until very recently a little kid inside myself still used to believe that world peace was indeed a thing that could be achieved if enough people really wanted it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My bike was stolen while I was away for the weekend, and the moment I realized that I would need to spend $300+ on a new bike for commute, the first thought that came to mind was: "Wow, there sure are a lot of disgusting, horrible people out there." I believe in a good world, I really do. I profess to be one of the more naive minds amongst my peers, almost to the point of being childishly innocent.  But situations like this make me realize that the world isn't honey and nectar after all, and that reality isn't as golden as the Peter Pan inside myself wants it to be. Yes, I know that a lot of it has to do with the fact that my parents have made so many sacrifices as to make me think that this world is indeed my little oyster. But I myself had also actively blocked out a lot of the negativity and instead only focused on the bright side of the world, possibly in hopes of tricking myself into thinking that doing so would somehow make this world a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
            It didn't. No matter what I see and how I think, the cruel reality is that there are illogical terrorist attacks and unfortunate, heart-wrenching casualties taking place every single day (if you think it's an exaggeration, just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_July_2016">this Wikipedia link</a> of the list of terrorst attacks in July 2016 - the list is a lot longer than it should, and it sickens me.) A younger version of myself would have racked his head, looking to make sense of what obviously doesn't, and trying to find a solution that would rectify all wrongs. But now, all I can do is sit back while browsing through the thousands of articles delivering one bad news after another, feeling hopeless but unable to do anything to not feel so lost.
        </p>
        <p>
            An ideal college essay would have my version of the answer right at about this point in the essay. But truth is that I don't have one, and I'm not sure if there would ever be an answer to this question - the question that mankind has not been able to solve since the dawn of time. I want to reassure my younger self and tell him that the world is as beautiful as he thought it was, but <strong>recent news makes me doubt whether I, or anyone else, for that matter, would be qualified to say anything of the sort.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            And so I close my eyes yet another time with a heavy heart, hoping that tomorrow would be a tad better than today.

            I didn't think that I'd be writing this much about the NBA. But then again, I didn't think that the offseason would be this dynamic, with massive changes taking place every other day, or so it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Big story of the day: <strong>Tim Duncan has retired.</strong> Now, I've never professed myself to be a TD fan - in fact, I had even tried to <em>become</em> his fan when I was in middle school, only to be disappointed by his lackluster highlight films. And even now, after 10+ years, I have yet to understand just how proficient he had been in the art of basketball.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet his retirement really stings because of what he had brought to the table for the past 19 years: <strong>humble greatness</strong>. Despite all the limelight that his fellow peers receive, not once has Timmy craved for attention - rather, he just stuck to what he did best, which was to win basketball games. In an era where exposure seems to be more valued than skills (Exhibit One: Nick Young, and the media exposure that he gets), Timmy really showed what it is like to be a humble superstar, an oxymoron that's much harder to live out than it is to say. That he had carried himself the way he did all throughout his career, despite being one of the all-time greats, should receive more accolades than any other NBA news has for the past few weeks, if not years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The word <em>respect</em> has not been this suitable for a single individual in a long time. Much respect, TD.

        <p>First off, I have to talk about just how fast time has zipped by. It's already July, for God's sake, and I'm shocked that it's already been a month since I started working at Aqueti, and two months since I was in Myrtle Beach and Puerto Rico. It's kind of frightening to think that there's only two more months of summer to go, and a single month of work left. I guess it's time to make things count and step my game up.</p>

        <p>In other news, <strong>I'm going to be a Duke RA starting next semester!!</strong> It was literally out of nowhere, as I'd already signed a contract with an off-campus apartment and planned to stay there until graduation. Not only will I benefit financially, this will also help me make up for the fact that all my friends back from freshman year have graduated. This news is probably something that hasn't really sunk in yet, but once it does I know it's going to be awesome, one that I'll really be grateful for. Come to think of it, I'm sure it'll be really challenging, considering how I'd be in charge of at least 30 people, all of whom are freshmen. Also better start getting ready for a <em>lot</em> more socializing than I'd been expecting to do, especially considering how lost I was back in my own freshman year.</p>

        <p>The website idea for Nicole on our anniversary is still in its very early stages. Not only do I have doubts about whether it's a good idea - it probably is - but I also have tons of questions with regards to how it should be implemented, whether it be design, content, pictures...mostly design probably. Should I use an external template, which I don't know much about? Should I try to make my own, at the risk of it looking childish and dumb? I think Nicole would probably prefer an external template, so I guess I'll just go with that for now. Hmm, this really is turning out to be a head-scratcher.</p>

        <p>On another note, the bike issue has finally come to an end...in a really really bad way, though probably not the worst(that would be me having to pay for the disposal as well). This stings really bad. The seller's a mofo, and I'm probably no better, being that gullible and everything. I bet he had a good laugh over everything.</p>

            This blog was created as a spinoff to Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS course. Let's see where it goes.

<!--         <p>Life off campus has been one of the best parts of my new routine. Not only am I eating food that I really wanted to eat, I'm eating it for really cheap. </p>

        <p>My room is quite spacious, and the rent is mind-bogglingly low. This is actually quite awesome. I wish the blog would let me post pictures of my room, just so I can show how great it is, but oh well.</p>
