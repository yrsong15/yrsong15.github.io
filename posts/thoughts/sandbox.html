		If there's one thing that my two years in the military taught me, it's that the world is a lot more different than I had previously considered it to be. I'm fortunate enough to be able to say that I've been raised - nay, nurtured - by parents who were more than willing to go out of their own ways to invest in my future and sacrifice their own in order to get me whatever was best. As such, I'd lived in a bubble, albeit a very privileged one, that encouraged me to become the de facto leader in wherever I ended up. After all, I had received the best education the country had to offer, and as I was taught time and time again, success in the classroom would inevitably lead to its counterpart in life as a whole.
