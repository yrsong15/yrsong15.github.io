        <p>The website idea for Nicole on our anniversary is still in its very early stages. Not only do I have doubts about whether it's a good idea - it probably is - but I also have tons of questions with regards to how it should be implemented, whether it be design, content, pictures...mostly design probably. Should I use an external template, which I don't know much about? Should I try to make my own, at the risk of it looking childish and dumb? I think Nicole would probably prefer an external template, so I guess I'll just go with that for now. Hmm, this really is turning out to be a head-scratcher.</p>

        <p>On another note, the moped issue has finally come to an end...in a really really bad way, though probably not the worst(that would be me having to pay for the disposal as well). This stings really bad. The seller's a mofo, and I'm probably no better, being that gullible and everything. I bet he had a good laugh over everything.</p>

        <p>Life off campus has been one of the best parts of my new routine. Not only am I eating food that I really wanted to eat, I'm eating it for really cheap. </p>

        <p>My room is quite spacious, and the rent is mind-bogglingly low. This is actually quite awesome. I wish the blog would let me post pictures of my room, just so I can show how great it is, but oh well.</p>
