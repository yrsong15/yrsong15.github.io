            I didn't think that I'd be writing this much about the NBA. But then again, I didn't think that the offseason would be this dynamic, with massive changes taking place every other day, or so it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Big story of the day: <strong>Tim Duncan has retired.</strong> Now, I've never professed myself to be a TD fan - in fact, I had even tried to <em>become</em> his fan when I was in middle school, only to be disappointed by his lackluster highlight films. And even now, after 10+ years, I have yet to understand just how proficient he had been in the art of basketball.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet his retirement really stings because of what he had brought to the table for the past 19 years: <strong>humble greatness</strong>. Despite all the limelight that his fellow peers receive, not once has Timmy craved for attention - rather, he just stuck to what he did best, which was to win basketball games. In an era where exposure seems to be more valued than skills (Exhibit One: Nick Young, and the media exposure that he gets), Timmy really showed what it is like to be a humble superstar, an oxymoron that's much harder to live out than it is to say. That he had carried himself the way he did all throughout his career, despite being one of the all-time greats, should receive more accolades than any other NBA news has for the past few weeks, if not years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The word <em>respect</em> has not been this suitable for a single individual in a long time. Much respect, TD.

            I woke up to a random Groupme text that a diehard OKC friend of mine had sent to another friend, a native of SF. The text read: <strong>"I hate your stupid basketball team!!!!!"</strong> It took a while for my still-asleep brain to process what had happened: that Kevin Durant announced his decision to join the Warriors.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was disheartening on so many levels. One, he would no longer be joining the Celtics, my fav (I actually asked Nicole to get me a Durant Celtics jersey for our anniversary gift - I really did believe there was a chance). Two, another franchise player had left his team, making it one less superstar to follow the paths of the Stocktons, Kobes, Duncans, and Dirks (this was why the Derrick Rose trade to the Knicks made total sense on a basketball level, but not so much on an emotional level). And three, perhaps most importantly, the league will now be seeing another SuperTeam, this time in the form of the Splash Fam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charles Barkley famously noted back in 2012 that a superteam would never have been possible in the 80s and the 90s because players' egos were too big to join forces with their rivals. And heartbreaking as it may be that greats like him, Stockton, and Malone never got to win a single ring, it was probably the <strong>very aspect of the game that made it so much more interesting</strong> - that you really didn't have a strong favorite, and even the dynasty, the Bulls, always had opponents thwarting them at every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, of course the Warriors will have their share of adversities. But everybody is going to take their championship status for granted, if they ever get there, and anything short of it would be considered a pathetic waste of talent. I've been a huge Steph Curry fan because of how humbly he carries himself and how electrifying his game is. The fact that LeBron was part of a SuperTeam himself back in Miami contributed a lot to why I rooted for GSW in the past two Finals. Now, Curry, Durant, and Thompson, three of my favorite players in the game right now, have joined forces. And unfortunately, it seems like basketball as we knew has taken a turn for the worse.

        <p>First off, I have to talk about just how fast time has zipped by. It's already July, for God's sake, and I'm shocked that it's already been a month since I started working at Aqueti, and two months since I was in Myrtle Beach and Puerto Rico. It's kind of frightening to think that there's only two more months of summer to go, and a single month of work left. I guess it's time to make things count and step my game up.</p>

        <p>In other news, <strong>I'm going to be a Duke RA starting next semester!!</strong> It was literally out of nowhere, as I'd already signed a contract with an off-campus apartment and planned to stay there until graduation. Not only will I benefit financially, this will also help me make up for the fact that all my friends back from freshman year have graduated. This news is probably something that hasn't really sunk in yet, but once it does I know it's going to be awesome, one that I'll really be grateful for. Come to think of it, I'm sure it'll be really challenging, considering how I'd be in charge of at least 30 people, all of whom are freshmen. Also better start getting ready for a <em>lot</em> more socializing than I'd been expecting to do, especially considering how lost I was back in my own freshman year.</p>

        <p>The website idea for Nicole on our anniversary is still in its very early stages. Not only do I have doubts about whether it's a good idea - it probably is - but I also have tons of questions with regards to how it should be implemented, whether it be design, content, pictures...mostly design probably. Should I use an external template, which I don't know much about? Should I try to make my own, at the risk of it looking childish and dumb? I think Nicole would probably prefer an external template, so I guess I'll just go with that for now. Hmm, this really is turning out to be a head-scratcher.</p>

        <p>On another note, the bike issue has finally come to an end...in a really really bad way, though probably not the worst(that would be me having to pay for the disposal as well). This stings really bad. The seller's a mofo, and I'm probably no better, being that gullible and everything. I bet he had a good laugh over everything.</p>

        <p>Life off campus has been one of the best parts of my new routine. Not only am I eating food that I really wanted to eat, I'm eating it for really cheap. </p>

        <p>My room is quite spacious, and the rent is mind-bogglingly low. This is actually quite awesome. I wish the blog would let me post pictures of my room, just so I can show how great it is, but oh well.</p>
