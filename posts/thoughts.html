            <strong>What is logic?</strong> I’m sure millions of scholars have chipped in on this abstract yet all-too-important topic, but just as all important topics go, the question has yet to be answered definitively, if ever. 
        </p>
        <p>

            My personal take is that logic is a systematic method of reasoning characterized by inductive steps. Logic is beautiful because it is <strong>science in its verbal form</strong> – regardless of the profession in which you indulge in, you need logic to elucidate your claims, whether it be computer science, cooking, chore instructions, or everything in between. Sound logic requires no explanation because its brevity and lucidity is enough in and of itself. You’ll know it when you see one – it’s one of those explanations that make you think, “Why haven’t I thought of this before!” or “How did I not understand this before!”

            Entering college, I wanted to be an economics major – a very rich field in its own right, but one that tends to focus a lot on theories and models, especially in the undergraduate level. After a whole year’s worth of if’s and maybe’s, my first computer science class that I signed up on a complete whim, Data Structures and Algorithms by Professor Azhar, absolutely captivated me. It was so clear-cut, and the answers were always very straightforward, in that you were either right, or you weren’t – there was no shade of gray.
        </p>

            However, as beautiful computer code was, I was stuck by the subtle nuances of programming syntax a lot more often than I would have wanted to. My head knew exactly what it wanted to do, but my hands could not execute the commands that my brain had come up with.  As stress built up, I even started to question whether computer science was my thing to begin with. If it took 3 hours just to solve this simple question, how would I ever be able to come up with the next Facebook, or the next Snapchat?
        </p>
        <p>
            It was only after months and months of Stack Overflow and office hours that I first ran into the concept of <strong>Computational Thinking</strong>, which would teach students to think systematically and programmatically <strong>without having to go through the burdens of computer code syntax</strong> – a concept highlighted by <a href="https://projectbloks.withgoogle.com/">Google’s Project Bloks</a>, as well as scholarly works of eminent researchers including <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wing/">Dr. Jeannette Wing</a> of Carnegie Mellon University. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This concept was the very essence of why I fell in love with computer science – the realization of logic. I tend to think of computer science as Lego blocks that I used to play with as a child, in that <strong>each line of code is a block that makes up a make-alike miniature world of my dreams.</strong> In addition to classwork and RA responsibilities, I intend to conduct research on this subject so that I can best utilize the resources granted to me by Duke, and also to satiate my academic thirst in a field that I haven’t felt so passionate towards in a very long time.
