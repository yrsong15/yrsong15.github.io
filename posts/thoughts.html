            As part of an ongoing research on <strong>Computational Thinking</strong>, I was able to listen to Dr. Jeannette Wing's CSTA talk on the concepts, present, and future of CT. Here are some of my reflections on her discussion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - It was interesting how Dr. Wing considered computers to be either machines or humans - this means that she regards humans as just another form of computers that can carry out algorithms and programs. I especially enjoyed her comparison of <strong>instructions for baking chocolate chip cookies</strong> to a computer program.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Dr. Wing emphasized how software is the key factor that differentiates CT from math or engineering, in that CT is not bound by laws of physics or nature. Her quote - <strong>"Creativity is only limited by human thought"</strong> - was especially captivating in that it reflected the very reason I myself took up computer science in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            - While she was pleasantly surprised by how CT has garnered a wide audience, the problems that follow - namely, the lack of foundation on what concepts should be taught to certain age groups - are issues that should be dealt by researchers. Her example of <strong>recursion</strong> was interesting in that even college-level students have a hard time grasping how it works, much less elementary school students. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - Following from the above bullet point, I was surprised to learn that the education side of CT is the main field of research in the status quo. It seems that the curriculum has been established to a certain point, but researchers are still working on when each concept should be taught to students.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Though computers are becoming more widely distributed across the world, students are not really interested in how computers actually work. Instead of asking how to use a certain feature, the ideal goal would be to have students ask questions such as: <strong>"How does everything fit inside this computer?"</strong>, which would lead to discussions on important CT concepts including compression and digitization.
