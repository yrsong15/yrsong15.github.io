             A lot has happened in life over the past few days: Nicole and I celebrated our first anniversary in New York, Pokemon GO fad is still raging on, I've started picking up Bootstrap and RoR, I'll be working as a CS230 TA next semester, my bike was stolen from my apartment over the weekend, and work is almost coming to a close. And as important as these matters are, they can be written about some other time. Today I want to discuss something on a more serious note - current issues, especially the <strong>shootings/bombings</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So much has happened over the past month, nay, the past week, that I fear I might even grow a little oblivious to all the horrors taking place in this world. The main storyline here in the US has been the Black Lives Matter campaign following two separate casualties in Baton Rouge and Minnesota, which then (perhaps indirectly, but nevertheless) led to the police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge. As chaos unfolded in the States, France suffered from a horrific incident in Nice involving a deranged truck, Turkey faced a coup-de-etat, and people are being executed in Syria as I write these feeble words, feeling absolutely helpless.

            When I was young(well, I guess I'm still young at 23, but you know what I mean), I wanted to be a diplomat, not just because I was more fluent in English than my Korean peers, but because I really did think that world peace would be attainable. Change happened somwhere along the way and now I call myself a computer engineer, but deep inside, until very recently a little kid inside myself still used to believe that world peace was indeed a thing that could be achieved if enough people really wanted it. 
        </p>

            My bike was stolen while I was away for the weekend, and the moment I realized that I would need to spend $300+ on a new bike for commute, the first thought that came to mind was: "Wow, there sure are a lot of disgusting, horrible people out there." I believe in a good world, I really do. I profess to be one of the more naive minds amongst my peers, almost to the point of being childishly innocent.  But situations like this make me realize that the world isn't honey and nectar after all, and that reality isn't as golden as the Peter Pan inside myself wants it to be. Yes, I know that a lot of it has to do with the fact that my parents have made so many sacrifices as to make me think that this world is indeed my little oyster. But I myself had also actively blocked out a lot of the negativity and instead only focused on the bright side of the world, possibly in hopes of tricking myself into thinking that doing so would somehow make this world a better place.
        </p>

            It didn't. No matter what I see and how I think, the cruel reality is that there are illogical terrorist attacks and unfortunate, heart-wrenching casualties taking place every single day (if you think it's an exaggeration, just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_July_2016">this Wikipedia link</a> of the list of terrorst attacks in July 2016 - the list is a lot longer than it should, and it sickens me.) A younger version of myself would have racked his head, looking to make sense of what obviously doesn't, and trying to find a solution that would rectify all wrongs. But now, all I can do is sit back while browsing through the thousands of articles delivering one bad news after another, feeling hopeless but unable to do anything to not feel so lost.
        </p>

            An ideal college essay would have my version of the answer right at about this point in the essay. But truth is that I don't have one, and I'm not sure if there would ever be an answer to this question - the question that mankind has not been able to solve since the dawn of time. I want to reassure my younger self and tell him that the world is as beautiful as he thought it was, but <strong>recent news makes me doubt whether I, or anyone else, for that matter, would be qualified to say anything of the sort.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            And so I close my eyes yet another time with a heavy heart, hoping that tomorrow would be a tad better than today.
