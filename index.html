        <p>The website idea for Nicole on our anniversary is still in its very early stages. Not only do I have doubts about whether it's a good idea - it probably is - but I also have tons of questions with regards to how it should be implemented, whether it be design, content, pictures...mostly design probably. Should I use an external template, which I don't know much about? Should I try to make my own, at the risk of it looking childish and dumb? I think Nicole would probably prefer an external template, so I guess I'll just go with that for now. Hmm, this really is turning out to be a head-scratcher.</p>

        <p>Aqueti has been a pleasant surprise for me. Not only am I exposed to the startup environment, which is something that is totally new for me, I am also gaining a very good insight into the industry's view of computer science. I still have a <span id = "long">long</span> way to go, but hopefully this will lead to something good.</p>

        <p>Life off campus has been one of the best parts of my new routine. Not only am I eating food that I really wanted to eat, I'm eating it for really cheap. </p>

        <p>My room is quite spacious, and the rent is mind-bogglingly low. This is actually quite awesome. I wish the blog would let me post pictures of my room, just so I can show how great it is, but oh well.</p>

        <h6 class = "date">Posted on June 19th, 2016</h6>
        
        <p>Just got back from New York, the first time we've actually met in the Big Apple - if anyone still calls New York that. It was a magical time for sure, full of adventures and just as, if not more, rewarding.</p>
        <p>
        First we met up near her place and went to Times Square, more specifically the Disney shop. We initially wanted to pick up Stitch, but seeing how the Stitches were either too big or too ugly, we instead went for Nemo, who is now safely tucked up with Nicole. </p>
        <p>Then we headed to Central Park, where Nicole, being the <em>angel</em> that she is, opened up the picnic lunch that she prepared herself - a Nutella sandwich, plus a plethora of fruits. There we watched a little baby called Peter try to feed the pigeons. Our favorite part was when he said "Thank you Pretzel!" to the grandma who gave him the aforementioned bread, and when he just threw a whole large chunk of the pretzel onto the ground, instead of breaking it up into little pieces. </p>
        <p>Then we headed to Koreatown to eat <em>Sundubu</em> - a soft type of Tofu that is usually cooked with spicy soup and seafood. I myself felt that the weather was hot, which is why I went for <em>naengmyun</em> - cold noodles in meat broth. The food was almost shockingly good, considering how my expectations for Korean food in the States have been crawling the dungeons. The good was genuinely delicious, and I could not help but wonder how fantastic it would be if we could go out every weekend enjoying such food - sans the financial burdens, of course.</p>
        <p>After lunch and a little bit of shopping in VC, we went for a nice bowl of <em>bingsu</em> - shaved ice with condiments and toppings of our choice. Since Nicole had mango <em>bingsu</em> just a week ago, we opted for a strawberry one, which was downright delicious. With Korean music - albeit, K-pop idol music that neither of us are big fans of - booming from the speakers, it really did feel as if we were in Korea. It also kind of reminded me of the times we first met, before we even went out, when we had <em>bingsu</em> for the first time.</p>
        <p>We found ourselves in an unexpected tourist place: the Memorial Tower. It was by sheer chance that we ran into this place, mostly because I took the wrong turn after getting off the subway. But my God, was the place beautiful or what? Nicole and I stood in awe as we watched the majestic tower and the commemorative waterfall, stricken by the largesse that the US pays for its fallen. </p>
        <p>The events continued into the evening, with Brooklyn Bridge probably being the high point of our trip, in terms of picturesque moments. For obvious reasons, I had thought that we would be visiting where I had taken the Brooklyn Bridge photo with the guys over Thanksgiving - it was the only place I knew of. But Nicole had other ideas - better ideas, as it turns out - and we headed to the bridge itself. To be honest I was not entirely sure whether the idea would work out, but the photos obviously turned out to prove me very wrong.</p>
        <p>The night culminated in us watching the movie I had been waiting on for God knows how long - <strong><em>Finding Dory</em></strong>. She probably wasn't as fired up as I was about the movie, if at all, but fortunately the short film before the beginning of the movie, <em>Piper</em>, seemed to have won her over at least a little bit. The movie itself was great, and baby Dory was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen.</p>

        <p>I miss Nicole. What more is there to say. Even as I am working on this project(it is <strong><em>12:19AM</em></strong>, for god's sake) she still has not returned from work. I know that I'm not the biggest fan of the Wall Street culture, but I should definitely be much more warm and supportive of her, seeing how much trouble she seems to be going through right now.<br>
